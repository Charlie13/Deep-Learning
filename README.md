# (GitHub-Flavored) Markdown Editor

Basic useful feature list:

 * Ctrl+S / Cmd+S to save the file
 * Ctrl+Shift+S / Cmd+Shift+S to choose to save as Markdown or HTML
 * Drag and drop a file into here to load it
 * File contents are saved in the URL so you can share files

I'm no good at writing sample / filler text, so go write something yourself.

Look, a list!

 * foo
 * bar
 * baz

And here's some code! :+1:

```javascript
$(function(){
  $('div').html('I am a div.');
});
```

This is [on GitHub](https://github.com/jbt/markdown-editor) so let me know if I've b0rked it somewhere.

Props to Mr. Doob and his [code editor](http://mrdoob.com/projects/code-editor/), from which
the inspiration to this, and some handy implementation hints, came.

### Stuff used to make this:

 * [js-deflate](https://github.com/dankogai/js-deflate) for gzipping of data to make it fit in URLs
### Choosing the right estimator
 Often the hardest part of solving a machine learning problem can be finding the right estimator for the job.
 Different estimators are better suited for different types of data and different problems.
 The flowchart below is designed to give users a bit of a rough guide on how to approach problems with regard to which estimators to try on your data.
